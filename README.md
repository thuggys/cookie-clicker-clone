Description
This project is an open-source clone of the popular game Cookie Clicker, designed for students at Zero To Mastery (ZTM) to practice and enhance their web development skills. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a simple yet engaging platform for learning front-end development techniques. Players click on a cookie to earn cookies, which they can then use to purchase upgrades and items that generate cookies automatically, increasing their cookie production rate.

The game features a dynamic UI that updates the number of cookies and the cost of items in real-time, implementing basic game mechanics, event handling, and animations. It's a fun way to dive into the world of web development, offering plenty of opportunities for customization and improvement.
Challenges and Contributions
We encourage students and contributors to dive into the project, fix bugs, add new features, and improve the game's functionality and design. Here are some challenges and feature ideas to get you started:
Feature Ideas
1. Save Game Feature: Implement a feature to save the game's state locally or on a server, allowing players to continue from where they left off.
2. Achievement System: Create an achievement system that rewards players for reaching specific milestones, such as earning a certain number of cookies or purchasing a number of upgrades.
3. Theme Customization: Allow players to customize the game's theme, including the background, cookie image, and UI colors.
4. Additional Upgrades and Items: Introduce new upgrades and items for purchase, each with unique benefits and cookie production rates.
